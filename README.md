ntp-fix-time
============

**Summary:** Fix OS X time using ntpdate. For some reason, OS X does not to keep very good time lately, so I wrote this script to force it in sync every few hours.

(Yes, Unix operating systems _do_ have tools which are supposed to do this automatically. For some reason OS Xâ€™s have not been working well for me, at least through Mountain Lion.)

## Automated Installation Instructions

	curl -sfL 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tjluoma/ntp-fix-time/master/install-ntp-fix-time.sh' | zsh -f

That's a really long line. Make sure you get all of it, or use this shorter alternative:

	curl -sfL http://luo.ma/install-ntp-fix-time.sh | zsh -f
